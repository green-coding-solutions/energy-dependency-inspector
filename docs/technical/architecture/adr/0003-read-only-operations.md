# ADR-0003: Read-Only Operations Constraint

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The dependency resolver needs to operate in various environments including CI/CD pipelines and containerized applications. Implementation approaches considered:

1. Allow modifications and installations to gather complete dependency information
2. Implement read-only operations with limitations on available information
3. Hybrid approach with optional modification capabilities

## Decision

We will implement a strict read-only operations constraint across all dependency detection activities.

## Rationale

Read-only operations ensure the dependency resolver can be safely used in any environment without risk of system modification or side effects.

**Constraint Details**:

- **No Downloads**: Avoid downloading files from internet or package repositories
- **No Installations**: Avoid installing additional tools on target systems
- **No Modifications**: All operations must be read-only on target environment
- **No System Changes**: No configuration file modifications or temporary file creation

**Implementation Impact**:

- Use existing system tools and package managers only
- Rely on locally available package metadata
- Query existing package databases without updates
- Work with current environment state as-is

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Safe to run in production environments without risk
- **Positive**: No internet connectivity requirements
- **Positive**: No administrative privileges needed for basic operations
- **Positive**: Consistent behavior regardless of network or permission constraints
- **Positive**: No cleanup required after execution
- **Negative**: Limited to information available in current system state
- **Negative**: Cannot gather additional metadata that might require downloads
- **Negative**: May miss some dependency information in minimal environments
- **Negative**: Cannot verify package integrity against remote sources
